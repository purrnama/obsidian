title: Analog and digital signals
---

Analog signals exist in the real world and they have indefinite values.

Digital signals are used in computers and they have discrete values.

A good example is an analog clock and a digital clock.

The hand of an analog clock may show that its pointing at a certain minute, but if you zoom in, the hand does not point it exactly, but rather approximate to that marking. This means the position of the hand is in an indefinite range of values.

In a digital clock, you know exactly what time it is right now, either 9:15 or 9:16, but never in between. That means the values are discrete.
