title: Student and Lecture's desire
---
A lecturer wants every student to succeed.
When a student fails, there will be punishment for the lecturer in the form of redoing the lectures again for the failed students without extra pay.

A student wants to get good grades so they can be competitive with other graduates in the job market.
They also want to gain insight.

Getting A in the exams does not mean you are 'smart', it means that you are reliable and dedicated and have prepared well for the given task.

Success requires preparation and **LUCK**, by being in the right place at the right time. Despite that, you must gain the skills and abilities in order to create your own luck.
