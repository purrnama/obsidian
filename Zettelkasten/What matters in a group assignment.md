# What matters in a group assignment

In a group assignment, it matters not who did what, only what has been done.

So your first priority is to make sure that the job must be done, by picking up other people's slack where possible.

Then you can begin disputing over the contribution of your group members. Any member that does not contribute anything will be given the necessary judgement.
