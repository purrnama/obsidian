title: Fiber Optic Cabling
---

Fiber optic cables transmit data in the form of light. They are more expensive than copper cables, but they are completely immune to EMI/RFI interference. They are best used for transmitting over long distances

### Single Mode Fiber

Diameter of glass core: 9 microns
Light travels in a single straight path using expensive laser
For long distance applications

### Multi Mode Fiber

Diameter of glass core: 50/62.5 microns
Multiple light paths travel at different angles in a larger core using less expensive LEDs
Distance up to 550 meters
