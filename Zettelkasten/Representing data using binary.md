title: Representing data using binary
---

Binary only has 2 values, 0 and 1

0
1
Two values

By adding more characters, you can represent more data

00
01
10
11
Four values

A byte has 8 bits, so using this formula:
$$R = B^k$$

R, range of values
B, number of values in binary = 2
k, number of characters

You can represent 256 values using bytes

This is basically how ASCII works
