title: Writing a report
---

A report should not be a textbook or an advertisement. What this means is, it should not only include a description of the topics you are discussing, but also provide your own contributions to that topic, through perspective and reflection. It should also be written in a neutral manner, as in not in a persuasive style of writing.

### Report contents

- Be descriptive (What and how)
- Then write the why (Why should you care)
- Give criticism (Discuss the pros and cons)
