Topology is the diagram of a network, and how devices are connected to each other

#### WAN Topologies
- Point-to-point: Permanent link between 2 points
- Hub and spoke: Similar to star topology, many points to 1 central point
- Mesh: All points connected to each other, high availability but require each node to be online
#### LAN Topologies
Typically used today
- Star
- Extended Star
#### Legacy Topologies
Not used anymore, and don't answer with these
- Bus
- Ring
