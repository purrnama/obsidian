# System thinking vs. Analysis

Analysis is the process of breaking down something into smaller components to better understand it. It feels similar to systems thinking but has a few key assumptions:

- The world stands still when we study it
- Puzzling situations will stand still as we break it into components
- Relationship of things are not important

System thinking is looking at a system as a whole, considering 1 outcome will affect components in the entire system.
