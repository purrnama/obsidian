title: Message Timing
---

There are many aspects of message timings that need consideration

## Flow control

How much or how fast information can be sent between devices.

For example, 1 computer can send 20 packets at a time, while the recipient could only accept 10 packets at a time. So the sender will only send at that speed in order for the recipient to receive the packets properly.

## Response timeout

How long should a device wait for a reply.

## Access method

Control when someone could send a message at a given time in order to prevent collisions.

Similar to talking in real life, one should wait for the other person to finish talking in order to communicate properly.
