title: How some solutions can cause more problems
---

If you do not understand the inter-relationship of things, a solution to one problem could potentially lead to other problems in other related factors.

You have to consider different elements that impact a certain problem, using the process of _zooming out_.

That way you can find different values and perspectives, which can result in better evaluation and help produce more opportunities for an effective solution.
