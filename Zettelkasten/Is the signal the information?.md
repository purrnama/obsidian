title: Is the signal the information?
---
In a digital signal, the signal is not the information, but a *representation* of the information. This is because the signal can be interpreted or reconstructed to reproduce the information.

In an analog signal, the signal IS the information. This is why analog television appears noisy due to interference, but digital TVs appear cleaner, because the signal can be reconstructed.

Digital signals are easier to do error checking, because you are able to tell the difference between exactly values, and what is out of place.
