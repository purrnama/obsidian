title: Why plagiarism is bad
---

Citation is a way of linking new knowledge to old knowledge

Without citation, we do not know if the research is relevant. Relevancy can differ based on how the experiment is executed, and whether the results can be considered accurate or not.

If an old research is proven to be false, the research that cites that old research will also be false.

Plagiarism is deliberately copying someone else's work without citation and claiming the research as your own.

If you plagiarize, you are not an author, and you have no _authority_.
