title: Being aware of your way of thinking
---

Asking feedback and opinions can give you a different point of view and idea

"Wow, I've never thought of that"

There are times when you are best at generating ideas:

- probably in the bathroom
- while exercising
- looking at nature, etc.

Be aware of your own thinking style and others, and be willing to act outside of your preferred thinking style
