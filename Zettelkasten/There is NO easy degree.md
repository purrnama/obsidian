# There is NO easy degree

All degree programs regardless of subject comes with their own sets of difficulties and challenges, and none of them are an easy way forward.

What matters is that you know your interests and objectives, and have the right mentality.

Ultimately, the most important person in your life is YOURSELF. You have to decide for yourself what you want to do. No one will be there to tell that to you.
