title: Characteristics of a system
---
### Is it a heap or a system?
Does removing components from a particular group affect the other components?

### Is the whole greater than the sum of its parts?
Systems contain what is known as *emergent properties*, which are properties that appear only when different components are working together.

An example is the parts of a car. You can break apart the different components of a car and reassemble it with no loss of mass, but you cannot guarantee the comfort and speed of the car will be the same. These are the emergent properties of the car as a system.

### Does it have a purpose?
### Do the components create a feedback loop?

### Are we experiencing Déjà vu?
Systems tend to behave in similar ways, despite being in completely different settings
