What does it mean to think logically?

It is a systematic way of thinking based on the process of thought

For example:

a = b,
a = c,
therefore logically,
b = c

1 instruction can be broken down into many sub-instructions.

"Go downstairs and buy a drink at the cafeteria"

A gate meanwhile is a structure that opens and closes an entrance
