UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
STP - Shielded Twisted Pair
Coaxial - Connection between wireless transceivers

Twisting of wire pairs prevent cross-talk by cancelling magnetic fields between each wire of opposing polarity. Each wire pair has a different amount of twisting.

## Shielding
Shielding prevents EMI/RFI interference
