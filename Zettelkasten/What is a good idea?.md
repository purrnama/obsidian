title: What is a good idea?
---

What counts a good idea? Is it because it brings a lot of benefit? How does it bring a lot of benefit?

A good idea may bring benefit according to one group of people, but it may not necessarily be good for another group of people.

Because things that are good or evil is a matter of perspective.

Therefore, things are good because it meets a certain criteria _that you set_.

In academia, you have to establish these criteria in order to explain how things are good and bad.
