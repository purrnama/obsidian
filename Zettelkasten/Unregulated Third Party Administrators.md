# Unregulated Third Party Administrators

It has been reported that there are illegal practices being conducted by Third Party Administrators (TPAs) and Managed Care Organisations (MCOs) that are not being regulated

Dr Muruga Raj Rajathurai, president of Malaysian Medical Association states that such matters have been put forth to the Ministry of Health since 2015, and no action has been made since.

### Examples of malpractices
- TPAs charge private general practitioners clinics substantial registration fees of RM5000 just to be appointed as panel clinic.
- TPAs obtain revenue from fee-splitting, through reduction of consultation fees or deduction (up to 10 to 15%) of final settlements to private clinics. Some also delay payments which leave them struggling financially.
- Outsourcing long-term medication prescriptions using e-prescriptions

### Implications
